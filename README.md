## My process

    My game plam was first and foremost setting up HTML, and :root of CSS with the colors and typography provided from the style guide. Afterwards, I set the proper displays/positions for each, careful not to overcowd with unnecessary inputs. Placed all the colors, then margins/padding, followed by hoverings, transitions, opacities and shadows.

### Built with

    - Custom CSS ( No frameworks this time )
    - Custom HTML
    - Flexbox
    - Google Fonts
    - A good eye!

### What I learned

    This was a fantastic CSS refresher, I learned even more about Flexbox as well as finetuned some of it ( Always, right? ) I learned that looking deeply at something can help you pinpoint exactly what you need to do in a lot of cases.
